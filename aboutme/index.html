    <p>
        My family moved to Pocatello, Idaho from Antioch, California over the summer.
        This is my first semester at BYUI after transfering from Los Medanos College in Pittsburgh, California.
        I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree.
        I enjoy playing flute, piano, and singing.
        I served my mission in Las Vegas after being reassigned from Tokyo North due to Covid.

        I have been a member of the church all my life. 
        My favorite speaker from among the brethren is Elder Jeffrey R. Holland.
        My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited to work with all of you this semester!
